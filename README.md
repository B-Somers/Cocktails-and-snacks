# Cocktails and Snacks

## Quick description 
The website is interactive and funny, you never know what snack will it offer you with your choice of cocktails

## Concept
    Description: This web page prompts user to enter a cocktail name. Which in turn will generate a few options of drinks. 

    Once a drink is selected the snack will automatically generate for the selected cocktail.


    Drinks should always go with food, and when trying a new drink, why not try a new food too?

    When a drink is selected, then we get a food attached to it. Drinks can be searched for but food is randomized.

## Process
    -The web page is built using: index.html, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript.

    -Break

    -Challenges were: Creating , Merging, Multi-user branching.

    -Successes: Working together as a team and accomplishing a central goal.

## Directions for Future Development
    This webpage has wide scale possibilities in the future to add recipes to both drinks and snacks, allowing users to look through ingredients and select a more personalized item.
